#Description
# D2DF stands for Destroy or Disable the Default Folder a small tool to disable some features or permanently remove unwanted folders, manually deleting it the media system can still create a folder on the sdcard (default automatically) and then I named it the default folder.

#What for
# - Folders become more compact because only the important ones are shown
# - Do not make the action of taking screenshots excessively / enable it if needed

# - And there may be many more.
